## Getting Started üö¶

Here are the instructions on how to setup this project in your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or above (recommended 3.11)
- Pip, the Python package installer
- Virtual environment (either virtualenv or Pipenv)
- An IDE (recommended: PyCharm or VSCode)
- For Windows users, Python should be added to the PATH and the command prompt should be used for the commands below.

### Installation

#### Virtual Environment Setup

For macOS and Linux:

```shell
# Create a virtual environment for Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv ~/.venvs/my-venv-name

# Activate the virtual environment
source ~/.venvs/my-venv-name/bin/activate

# Check the Python version inside the venv
python -V

# Install all dependencies 
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
For Windows:

```shell
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Check the Python version inside the venv
python -V

# Install all dependencies 
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Pipenv Setup
```shell
# Create a pipenv environment for Python 3
pipenv --three

# Activate the pipenv environment
pipenv shell

# If you have multiple Python 3 versions installed
pipenv install -d --python 3.9

# Install all dependencies (include -d for installing dev dependencies)
pipenv install -d

```

Usage üíª
After starting the server, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000/`. The API documentation can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.


## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

The application follows a modular structure. Each module encapsulates a business capability and is self-contained. The modules interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.

Here's a brief description of the existing modules:

- `user`: Handles user-related functionalities such as registration, authentication, and profile management.
- `social`: Manages social networking features like posts, comments, and likes.
- `shop`: Handles shop-related functionalities such as product listing, orders, and payments.

Each module has the following structure:

- `models.py`: Defines the database models for the module.
- `schemas.py`: Defines the Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
- `services.py`: Contains the business logic of the module.
- `routes.py`: Defines the API routes of the module.

To add a new module, create a new directory under `app/modules` with the structure described above. Then, import and include the module's routes in `app/api/routes.py`.

## Testing üß™

**Is Testing important ? Answer is Yes**
Developer don't know which part of our codebase may break! 
We use unit tests mostly for a single purpose. 
It works as documentation, By designing a unit test We help fellow developers, 
how exactly this new feature should work.

To run test 

```bash
  pytest -v app/tests
```
