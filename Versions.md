# Versioning System for RidingMoto Backend ðŸŽˆ

In this project, we follow the Semantic Versioning system. This means that our version numbers follow the format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Here's what each component means:

- **MAJOR:** This number is incremented when we make incompatible API changes.

- **MINOR:** This number is incremented when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.

- **PATCH:** This number is incremented when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additionally, we also use labels for different stages of the software release life cycle:

- **Alpha:** This label is used when the development is complete and initial testing is being done. The focus of this testing is functional.

- **Beta:** This label is used when the software is being tested in the "real world" by the target audience.

- **Canary:** This is a version of the software that is automatically released to a small subset of users to test for bugs and stability.

- **RC (Release Candidate):** This is a version with potential to be a final product, which is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. It's the last stage before the final release.

For example, a version number could look like this: 1.0.0-alpha. This would represent a major release that is still in alpha testing.
